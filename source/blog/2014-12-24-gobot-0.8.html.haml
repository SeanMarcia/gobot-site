  This release brings a number of very large and necessary changes to Gobot. Over time our interfaces have grown out of hand and are becoming unmanagable and largely unecessary. With the Gobot 0.8 release, we have completely changed the core interfaces as well as our gpio and i2c driver interfaces.

  In addition to this, we are finally correctly passing errors throughout the system and have removed all panics! Altough this is very exciting, this also means that there are many breaking api changes, especially if you have written your own drivers and adaptors.

  If you're not ready to update to the new interfaces or errors handling, then you're in luck! We create a tag with every new Gobot release, so rolling back to the previous release is as easy as:
    
      $ go get -d -u github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/...
      $ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hybridgroup/gobot
      $ git checkout 0.7.1
      $ go build -a github.com/hybridgroup/

  You really should update to the latest release however, it's much better!

  Here's a overview of the changes, but if you want to see more check out the compare view on [GitHub](https://github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/compare/0.7.1...0.8).
